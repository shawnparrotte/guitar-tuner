Day 1/100

Today's project was to create a guitar tuner.

I used jQuery for the main functionality: injecting the appropriate sound
files, repainting the fretboard as the window resized, and selecting the
correct tunings from the list.

Drawing the fretboard with divs was also quite entertaining. 

Update #1: Added mobile functionality by replacing the <embed> function with
methods from the CreateJS/SoundJS library.
